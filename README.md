# Stranger in London


## Assignment Overview
A long-awaited first assignment is finally here! Your task is to assist a lost traveler, Hazel, in finding suitable accommodation in London. Hazel traveled from afar, only to discover that his pre-booked hotel was unexpectedly closed due to a hazelnut tree falling at its entrance. 

While searching for alternatives at Heathrow, Hazel noticed you with your laptop—engrossed in Java programming and browsing TikTok. Without hesitation, he approached you, seeking help in finding the best place to stay for the next seven nights. Since you are reading this, you had no choice but to accept the challenge!

## Objectives
Hazel has specific criteria for his accommodation search. Your mission is to find the following:

1. **Cheapest shared room**
2. **Most expensive private room within a 10-kilometer radius of Big Ben**
3. **Accommodation located in the middle of the list for all places that have 'London' in their name**

## Implementation
- Use **Java** to implement the search functionality.
- Fetch and filter data from relevant accommodation databases.
- Ensure results are accurately ranked based on Hazel’s preferences.

## How to Run
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stranger-in-london.git

# Compile and run the Java program

## Future Enhancements
- Add a **GUI interface** for better user experience.
